One-server LAMP-like stack (Nginx + App + MySQL):
- Domain: foobar.com with a DNS record `www` -> **A record** pointing to 8.8.8.8.
- Server: single VM/host running:
  - Web server (Nginx): serves static files and forwards dynamic requests to the app server (reverse proxy).
  - Application server: runs your code (e.g., Gunicorn/uwsgi/Node/PM2/etc).
  - Application files: your code base deployed on the box.
  - Database (MySQL): stores persistent data.
- Client â†” Server communication: HTTP (or HTTPS) over **TCP/IP**.

Key definitions:
- Server: a computer/service providing resources to clients (here, web/app/db).
- Role of domain name: human-friendly name mapped to IP via DNS.
- `www` record type: **A** (hostname -> IPv4) as per requirement.
- Web server: terminates HTTP(S), static serving, reverse proxy to the app.
- App server: runs business logic, generates dynamic responses.
- Database: persists data (tables, indexes, queries).

Issues (single-box):
- **SPOF**: one host down = site down.
- **Maintenance downtime**: restarts/redeploys interrupt service.
- **No scale**: CPU/RAM/IO limited to one machine; cannot handle traffic spikes.
