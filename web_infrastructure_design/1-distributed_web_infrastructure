3-box layout with load balancer:
- HAProxy (LB) in front of 2 identical web+app servers; shared DB (Primary + Replica).
- Each of the 2 app boxes: Nginx (reverse proxy) + app server + code.
- DB layer: MySQL Primary (writes) + Replica (reads/standby).

Why add each element:
- Load balancer: spreads traffic, hides backends, enables rolling deploys.
- Second app server: **horizontal scale** and redundancy.
- DB replica: read offload and failover target.

LB algorithm:
- Example: **Round Robin** – sequentially cycles backends A,B,A,B,… to distribute requests.

Active-Active vs Active-Passive (LB):
- Active-Active: multiple backends serve traffic simultaneously (chosen here).
- Active-Passive: one active backend; passive one only serves if active fails.

MySQL Primary-Replica:
- Primary: accepts **writes**; replicates binlog to replica.
- Replica: applies changes; typically **reads** only.
- From the app view: writes go to Primary; reads can be directed to Replica (if implemented).

Remaining issues:
- SPOF: the **LB** and the **DB Primary** are still single points.
- Security: no **firewalls**, no **HTTPS**.
- No **monitoring**: no visibility/alerts.
