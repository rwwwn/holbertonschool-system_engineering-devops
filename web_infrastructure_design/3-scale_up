Add:
- **1 more server**.
- **Second HAProxy** clustered with the first (VRRP/keepalived or cloud LB) for LB HA.
- **Split tiers** onto dedicated hosts:
  - Web tier (Nginx) on its own servers.
  - App tier on separate servers (auto-scale friendly).
  - DB tier on dedicated DB nodes (Primary + Replica).

Why:
- Second LB removes LB SPOF; virtual IP/floating IP or DNS health checks.
- Tier separation isolates workloads (IO/CPU), enables independent scaling and deployments.
- Cleaner security policy (FW rules per tier), simpler troubleshooting, better SLOs.
