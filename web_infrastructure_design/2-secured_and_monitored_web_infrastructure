• Add 3 firewalls (edge, LB↔app, app↔DB), HTTPS with cert, and monitoring agents on LB/app/DB.
• Firewalls: least-privilege between tiers.
• HTTPS: confidentiality/integrity/authn.
• Monitoring: metrics+logs (QPS via Nginx logs/metrics).
Issues: TLS terminated only at LB leaves backend plaintext; single-writer DB; same components on boxes can contend.
